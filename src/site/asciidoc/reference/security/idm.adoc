# Identity Manager
[[main-title]]

## Description

And IDM is a server that centralizes all the identities of the users that have access to your internal company (machines and company intranet).
In Osgiliath, we have choosen to configured it using FreeIPA, which is composed of many different building blocks:

 * A Kerberos server to manage access to machines and services and centralize identity access
 * A KRA (PKI)
 * A DNS
 * A LDAP to store identities

## Installation

Installing the idm can be achieved using the https://github.com/OsgiliathEnterprise/ansible-securehost[Securehost] role.

Note that with the current behavior, your internal domain should not be referenced over the Internet (in a public DNS)

## Troubleshooting

 If you messed up with the IDM installation, you may encounter a `getting:sec_error_reused_issuer_and_serial` error when trying to connect with Firefox.

In this situation, start the firefox' profile-manager and delete your current profile: `firefox -ProfileManager`.
You can also try cleaning up your browser cache and removing th IDM's server certificates in the `certificates->server` section of the Preference.

Finally, as RHEL installs the FreeIPA idm CA in its trusted ca list, reinstall the ca certificate package: `sudo dnf reinstall ca-certificates`
