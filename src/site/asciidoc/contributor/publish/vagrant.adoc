# Publish your Vagrant boxes
[[main-title]]

Some of our Ansible roles are based on specific <<../../reference/packer/introduction.adoc#virtual-machines, boxes>>. +
These hosted to and downloaded from Vagrant Cloud in order to start the tests.
Following the https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/cloud.html[Official documentation], publishing box is fairly easy.
First login to vagrant cloud: `vagrant login`

Then publish the boxes under your namespace
```
vagrant cloud box create ORGANIZATION/BOX-NAME
vagrant cloud publish ORGANIZATION/BOX-NAME BOX_VERSION PROVIDER ./BUILT_BOX.PROVIDER.box
```
