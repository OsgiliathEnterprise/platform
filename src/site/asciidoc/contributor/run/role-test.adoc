[[main-title]]


Running test is fairly easy if you've installed the prerequisites.

First, start your machine using the `molecule create` command.

Once started, you can deploy your tasks using `molecule converge`

Once converged, you can `molecule verify` executing your tests on the machine.

Finally, `molecule destroy` will kill the VM/Docker container

TIP: Be sure to write your test before implementing so that you can see it failing, so to ensure that you are writing your test the good way !
