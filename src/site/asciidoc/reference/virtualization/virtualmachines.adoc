[[main-title]]

As stated in the << ../packer/introduction.adoc#main-title, introduction>>, Virtual machines are full machines, started from within your host's OS or hypervisor +
Within the platform, we are relying on multiple Virtualization technologies depending on the use case.

## Wipe VMS
Sometimes script can mess and you want to restart from a blank page.
As VMs are not that easy to manage, you should execute some commands in order to go back to the initial mode (contribution welcome to automate that ;-))

1. Delete the machines
You should first delete the machine:

```bash
sudo virsh list
sudo virsh destroy <the machines>
sudo virsh undefine <the machines>
```

2. Delete the dhcp host entries
```bash
sudo virsh net-dumpxml default
sudo virsh net-update default delete ip-dhcp-host "<host mac='52:54:00:49:67:77' id='01:52:54:00:49:67:77' name='master.osgiliath.net' ip='192.168.122.74'/>" --live
```

3. Delete the firewall redirection rules
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=public
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" forward-port port="22022" protocol="tcp" to-port="22" to-addr="192.168.122.74"' --zone=public
sudo firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent
```

4. Delete ssh hook
```bash
rm .ssh/authorizedOn*
```
