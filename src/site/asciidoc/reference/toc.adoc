# User guide

Welcome to the Information System as a service Platform.

Have you ever dreamed to choose useful applications and deploy your entire information system with a PR and a simple
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventories/my-server my-play.yml --ask-become-pass
```
So you have knocked on right door!

You're navigating through a documentation that will let you consume or configure your entire information system in a few command.

## Usage of the platform

This platform has been configured for a deployment on a single server.
It's a two step process: +

### First step: Cloning the entire repo

You should first clone the platform including submodules (ideally a fork): +

`git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git://github.com/foo/bar.git` +

Then, use the `./configure` scripts to get all the dependent libraries (python mostly)


### Second step: VM creation

The first roles to be executed will install and configure a virtualization technology then start three Virtual machines. It will also install a reverse proxy technology on the host and some dedicated storage as well

To configure it, tweak the `inventories/provision-vms` inventory
Then, configure ssh access on your client to your hosts editing .ssh/config file
```
Host host
    HostName host.osgiliath.net
    User cmordantlocal
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_osgiliath
    ForwardX11Trusted yes
    ForwardX11 yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
```
Then trigger the ansible playbook:

`ansible-playbook -i inventories/provision-vms osgiliath-provision.yml --vault-password-file .vault_pass.txt -K`

### Third step: VM provision

This third step will configure everything: NFS servers, kerberos, kubernetes, cni plugins, ...
To configure it, tweak the `inventories/configure-vms` inventory
Then, configure ssh access on your client to your VMS editing .ssh/config file and configuring passthrough:
```
Host node
    HostName node1.internal.osgiliath.net # be sure that this hostname is referenced in the /etc/hosts file of your host
    ProxyJump host
    ForwardAgent yes
    User cmordantlocal
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_osgiliath
```

Then trigger the ansible playbook:

`ansible-playbook -i inventories/configure-vms osgiliath-configure.yml --vault-password-file .vault_pass.txt -K`

#### Fourth step: configure kubectl

Finally, configure access to your kube master on your client:

First, configure a context in your kube cli config file (.kube/config)
```
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority: /Users/charliemordant/.ssh/kubeCA_osgiliath.crt
    # server: https://kubeadm.osgiliath.net:6443
    server: https://127.0.0.1:12345
    tls-server-name: kubeadm.osgiliath.net
users:
- name: kubeadmin.osgiliath
  user:
    client-certificate: /Users/charliemordant/.ssh/kubeAdm_osgiliath.crt
    client-key: /Users/charliemordant/.ssh/kubeAdm_osgiliath.pem

```

Your kube API should be accessible from your `master`'s `host` via the 6443 port (routed via the ansible_routing nginx run on docker)
