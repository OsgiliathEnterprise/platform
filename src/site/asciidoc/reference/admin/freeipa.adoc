# FreeIPA
[[main-title]]

Centralizing machine to machine and user to machine communication is a must have.
FreeIPA is a all in one choice: it's a wrapper solution which includes a LDAP (to centralize users, groups and certificate store), a PKI (and a KRA) to handle Certificate authority and certificate revocation, Kerberos to manage authentication as well as a nice user interface.

## Description

Basically, freeIPA is made of servers and replicas (idm server) which manages domains.
Then, all machines that should be part of that domain should be registered as IPA client among this server.
